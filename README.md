This is a project to recreate or reimagine the dice game "Tenzies", built as part of the React course on Scrimba. It was built with React and styled with CSS. The course covers the basics of the project, but I added the timer, the roll counter, the graphical die faces, and the start menu.

The goal of the game is to end with all 6 dice on the same face. 
Playing is simple: you start with 6 dice and begin by rolling all of them. You can then "set aside" any dice you want and roll again. You keep going until all of your held dice are the safe face. The less rounds, the better. It's like golf but even lazier!


Fun fact about the probabilities of this game: the chance of all 6 dice landing on the same number on the first roll is 1/(6^9) or 0.0000099229%. 
You're about 700 times more likely to be struck by lightning than you are winning Tenzies with a score of 1. Good luck!
